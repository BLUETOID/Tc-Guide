                        <p>Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, thoughts, feelings, and emotions through speech, signals, writing, or behavior between two or more people.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>The Role of Communication</h4>
                    <p>Communication plays a fundamental role in every aspect of human life. It serves as the foundation for building relationships, sharing knowledge, and achieving organizational goals.</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Information Sharing:</strong> Transmitting data, facts, and knowledge from one person to another</li>
                        <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> Aligning efforts and activities across individuals and teams</li>
                        <li><strong>Decision Making:</strong> Providing necessary information for informed decisions</li>

                    <h4>Purpose of Communication</h4>
                    <p>Every act of communication is driven by specific purposes. Understanding these purposes helps in crafting more effective messages.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>To Inform:</strong> Providing facts, data, and information to create awareness and understanding. Example: A manager informing employees about new policies.</li>
                        <li><strong>To Persuade:</strong> Convincing others to accept a particular viewpoint, idea, or course of action. Example: A sales pitch or a political speech.</li>
                        <li><strong>To Educate:</strong> Teaching new concepts, skills, or knowledge to enhance understanding. Example: Training sessions or academic lectures.</li>
                        <li><strong>To Entertain:</strong> Providing enjoyment, amusement, or relaxation. Example: Storytelling or humor in presentations.</li>
                        <li><strong>To Request:</strong> Asking for something, whether it's information, action, or resources. Example: Submitting a leave application.</li>

                    </ol>

                    <h4>Importance in Professional Context</h4>

                        <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Studies show that professionals spend approximately 70-80% of their working hours engaged in some form of communication—writing, reading, speaking, or listening.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>In organizational settings, effective communication:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h5>Real-World Example</h5>
                        <p>Consider a project manager who needs to communicate a deadline change. Effective communication ensures all team members understand the new timeline, the reasons for the change, and their adjusted responsibilities—preventing confusion and maintaining productivity.</p>

                        <h5>Definition</h5>
                        <p>Communication barriers are obstacles that prevent the effective exchange of ideas, information, or messages between the sender and receiver, leading to misunderstanding or communication failure.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>1. Physical Barriers</h4>
                    <p>Environmental and physical factors that obstruct communication:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Background sounds that interfere with message transmission</li>
                        <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Geographic separation between communicators</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> Poor phone connections, internet problems, faulty equipment</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical Environment:</strong> Poor lighting, uncomfortable seating, extreme temperatures</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Zone Differences:</strong> Challenges in global communication</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. Psychological Barriers</h4>
                    <p>Mental and emotional factors that affect communication:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Emotions:</strong> Anger, fear, anxiety, or excitement affecting message interpretation</li>
                        <li><strong>Prejudice and Bias:</strong> Preconceived notions about the sender or topic</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Attention:</strong> Distraction, daydreaming, or disinterest</li>
                        <li><strong>Perception Differences:</strong> Different interpretations based on past experiences</li>
                        <li><strong>Resistance to Change:</strong> Unwillingness to accept new ideas</li>
                        <li><strong>Poor Retention:</strong> Inability to remember information</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>3. Semantic Barriers</h4>
                    <p>Language-related obstacles in communication:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Language Differences:</strong> Different native languages or dialects</li>
                        <li><strong>Jargon:</strong> Technical terms unfamiliar to the receiver</li>
                        <li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> Words with multiple meanings causing confusion</li>
                        <li><strong>Complex Sentences:</strong> Overly complicated language structures</li>
                        <li><strong>Slang and Idioms:</strong> Informal expressions not universally understood</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h5>Example of Semantic Barrier</h5>
                        <p>The word "table" can mean: (1) a piece of furniture, (2) to postpone discussion (US), or (3) to bring up for discussion (UK). This difference can cause confusion in international meetings.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>4. Organizational Barriers</h4>
                    <p>Structural and cultural factors within organizations:</p>

                        <h5>Overview</h5>
                        <p>The 7 C's of Communication are fundamental principles that ensure messages are transmitted effectively and understood correctly. Following these principles improves both written and oral communication.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>1. Clarity</h4>
                    <p>The message should be clear and easily understandable. The sender must have a clear idea of what they want to communicate.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use simple, familiar words</li>
                        <li>Focus on one idea at a time</li>
                        <li>Avoid ambiguous language</li>
                        <li>Be specific rather than vague</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h5>Example</h5>
                        <p><strong>Unclear:</strong> "The meeting is sometime next week."<br><strong>Clear:</strong> "The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, January 14th at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B."</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>2. Conciseness</h4>
                    <p>Communication should be brief and to the point without sacrificing completeness or clarity.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases</li>
                        <li>Avoid repetition and redundancy</li>
                        <li>Use active voice where possible</li>
                        <li>Include only relevant information</li>
                    </ul>

                    </div>

                    <h4>3. Concreteness</h4>
                    <p>Messages should be specific, definite, and vivid rather than vague and general.</p>

                        <li>Use action verbs</li>
                        <li>Choose vivid, image-building words</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h5>Example</h5>
                        <p><strong>Vague:</strong> "Sales have improved significantly."<br><strong>Concrete:</strong> "Sales increased by 25% in Q3, generating ₹15 lakhs in additional revenue."</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>4. Correctness</h4>
                    <p>The message should be accurate in terms of facts, language, grammar, and format.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Verify facts and figures before communicating</li>
                        <li>Use proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation</li>
                        <li>Use appropriate level of language for the audience</li>
                        <li>Ensure technical accuracy</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>5. Coherence</h4>
                    <p>Ideas should be logically connected and flow smoothly from one point to another.</p>

                        <li>Ensure all parts relate to the main topic</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>6. Completeness</h4>
                    <p>The message should contain all necessary information the receiver needs to understand and respond.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Answer all questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)</li>
                        <li>Include all relevant details</li>
                        <li>Provide additional information if needed</li>
                        <li>Leave no room for confusion</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>7. Courtesy</h4>

                        <li><strong>Stimulus:</strong> Any message, signal, or event that triggers a reaction. In communication, the message sent by the sender acts as the stimulus.</li>
                        <li><strong>Response:</strong> The reaction or behavior that follows the stimulus. This is the receiver's feedback or action after receiving the message.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Communication Process</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Ideation:</strong> Sender develops an idea or thought to communicate</li>
                        <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> Sender converts the idea into a coded message</li>
                        <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> Message is sent through a channel (medium)</li>
                        <li><strong>Reception:</strong> Receiver receives the coded message</li>
                        <li><strong>Decoding:</strong> Receiver interprets the code to understand the message</li>
                        <li><strong>Response:</strong> Receiver reacts to the message (feedback)</li>

                        <p>Vowel sounds are speech sounds produced with an open vocal tract, without significant constriction or closure. They form the core of syllables and are essential for clear pronunciation and communication.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Characteristics of Vowel Sounds</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Produced with an open vocal tract</li>
                        <li>Air flows freely without obstruction</li>
                        <li>Voiced sounds (vocal cords vibrate)</li>

                        <li>Can be sustained for extended periods</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Classification of Vowel Sounds</h4>
                    <p>Vowels are classified based on three main criteria:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Tongue Height (Vertical Position)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High/Close Vowels:</strong> Tongue is raised (e.g., /iː/ in "see", /uː/ in "food")</li>
                        <li><strong>Mid Vowels:</strong> Tongue is in the middle (e.g., /e/ in "bed", /ɜː/ in "bird")</li>
                        <li><strong>Low/Open Vowels:</strong> Tongue is lowered (e.g., /æ/ in "cat", /ɑː/ in "father")</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>2. Tongue Position (Horizontal)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Front Vowels:</strong> Tongue is positioned forward (e.g., /iː/, /e/, /æ/)</li>
                        <li><strong>Central Vowels:</strong> Tongue is in the center (e.g., /ə/ in "about", /ʌ/ in "cup")</li>
                        <li><strong>Back Vowels:</strong> Tongue is positioned back (e.g., /uː/, /ɔː/ in "law")</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>3. Lip Rounding</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rounded Vowels:</strong> Lips are rounded (e.g., /uː/, /ɔː/, /ɒ/)</li>
                        <li><strong>Unrounded Vowels:</strong> Lips are spread or neutral (e.g., /iː/, /e/, /æ/)</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>Consonant sounds are speech sounds produced with significant constriction or closure of the vocal tract, creating friction, stoppage, or other modifications of the airflow. They work together with vowels to form syllables and words.</p>

                    <h4>Characteristics of Consonant Sounds</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Produced with some obstruction of airflow</li>

                    <h4>Classification by Manner of Articulation</h4>

                    <p><strong>1. Plosives (Stops)</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>4. Nasals</strong></p>
                    <p>Produced with airflow through the nose.</p>

                        <h5>Definition</h5>
                        <p>Intonation refers to the variation of pitch in speech. Rising and falling tones are fundamental intonation patterns that convey meaning, emotion, and grammatical structure in spoken communication.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Understanding Intonation</h4>
                    <p>Intonation is the melody of speech—the way our voice rises and falls while speaking. It helps convey:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type of sentence (question, statement, command)</li>
                        <li>Emotions and attitudes</li>
                        <li>Emphasis and focus</li>
                        <li>Completion or continuation of thought</li>
                        <li>Speaker's intention and mood</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Falling Tone (↘)</h4>
                    <p>The pitch of the voice moves downward at the end of the utterance. It indicates:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Finality and Completeness:</strong> The speaker has finished their thought</li>
